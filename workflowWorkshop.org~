CPAR is an acronym for the Collection, Preparation, Analysis and Reporting of data analyses.

1. Collect, Code, Curate, Check
2. Prepare, Process
3. Analyze
4. Report

*** Reproducible and Replicable

*** Organizing Folders and Files
Some questions:
- How will you find your files?
- How will you backup your files?
- How will you work on different computers?
- How will you work with collaborators
- How will you deal with multiple versions and revisions?

Some solutions:
- use a logical system to organize projects
- have a root directory
- use relative file paths

*** Documenting Decisions
- Document all decisions made while processing data
- Code scripts save you time and tears!!

*** Collection and Curation
- This includes data entry, coding, and storage. 
- It is important to create an accurate raw data file in archival form that is write protected.
- Entails converting from "field raw" data to "analytically raw" data (e.g. entering hand-written field notes into the computer).
  analytically raw is the initial form that can be used by a computer.

*** Processing and Preparing
- This includes cleaning and recoding of data. 
- It is important to create scripts to automate this process (or processes) and to document all decisions within the scripts.
- Merging files

*** Analysis 
- This includes the descriptive and inferential statistical models used to obtain knowledge from data.
- It is important to record and document all analyses and what is learned from them.

*** Reporting
- This includes internal lab reports, any conference presentations, memos to PIs, funder reports, or journal manuscripts.
- Ideally, literate programming is used to integrate analytic results directly into the reports to minimize human error (as little copying and pasting as possible).
