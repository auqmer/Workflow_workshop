## SEDA Data

10/21/19

This SEDA set is a combination of 2 sets from CEPA — The GeoDist and GeoDist Cov files. These are the Cohort Scale scores (not the Grade Cohort Standardized scores). See the documentation file pg. 30.

These files were merged in Stata and exported as a .csv

Use “~/Data/Syntax/SEDA_District_Setup.do” to add value labels and desiring variables
